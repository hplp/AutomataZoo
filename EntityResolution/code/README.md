# How was I generated
1. Run name_generator/name_generator.py
2. Benchmark was generated using 10000 database names and 1000000 input names with seed 7 (python name_generator.py 10000 1000000 7)
3. In name_generator.py, all hardcoded error probabilities were set to 0.05. Name occurence probability (the probability a name from the database occurs in the input) was set to 0.01
4. Automata was generated by running ./er ../name_generator/10000_names.db
