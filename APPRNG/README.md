# Automata Pseudo Random Number Generator Benchmark

## Description

A Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) is an algorithm that generates a stream of pseudo random numbers given a small amount of random or pseudo random seed data. This benchmark models Markov Chains with finite automata to generate high-throughput PRNG streams.

## Benchmark

This benchmark contains two benchmark instances: 4_sided and 8_sided PRNG. Each has an automata file and input.
