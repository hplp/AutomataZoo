# Levenshtein Distance Kernel Benchmark

## Description

The Levenshtein Distance between two strings is the minimum number of edit operations required to convert one string into the other, where the set of edit operations are: insert, delete, substitute. It is a scoring kernel used in a variety of applications.

A Levenshtein Distance kernel automaton is a finite state machine that recognizes strings within a configured edit distance of a comparison string. In order to explore the design space of this kernel, there are three different benchmark instances included in this benchmark.

## Benchmark

This benchmark contains three automata files and inputs.
