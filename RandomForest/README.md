# Random Forest Benchmark

## Description

Random Forest is a machine learning model based on an ensemble of decision trees. These trees can be transformed into several automata that run in parallel, each computing a separate traversal of the tree. This benchmark contains three instances of the Random Forest automata algorithm in order to explore the design space of this benchmark.

## Benchmark

This benchmark contains three automata files and one large and one small input per automata file.
