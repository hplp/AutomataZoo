# YARA Benchmark

## Description

YARA is a malware pattern description language that can be used to match 4-bit (nibble) hex patterns in files. These patterns can include wildcards and bounded/unbounded jumps.

## Benchmark

This benchmark contains two instances of the YARA benchmark, one for byte-level automata and also widened YARA rules that considers input data two bytes at a time.
