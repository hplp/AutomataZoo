# How was I generated?
YARA inputs were downloaded from a Malware repository located here: http://www.tekdefense.com/downloads/malware-samples/

Note the password for each .zip file is 'infected'.

YARA uses MALZ2.zip as its default input. All of the files in MALZ2.zip are concatenated together to form malware_malz2.input.
