# How was I generated?
YARA_wide inputs were downloaded from a Malware repository located here: http://www.tekdefense.com/downloads/malware-samples/

Note the password for each .zip file is 'infected'.

YARA_wide uses MALZ3.zip as its default input. All of the files in MALZ3.zip are concatenated together to form malware_malz3.input.
