# Hamming Distance Kernel Benchmark

## Description

The Hamming Distance between two strings of the same length is the sum of the number of characters that differ at each position in the pair of strings. It is a scoring kernel used in a variety of applications. A Hamming Distance kernel automaton is a finite state machine that recognizes strings within a configured edit distance of a comparison string. In order to explore the design space of this kernel, there are three different benchmark instances included in this benchmark.

## Benchmark

This benchmark contains three automata files and inputs.
