The PROSITE database was used to construct the protein signatures in this benchmark and should not be considered an identical copy of the signatures in the original PROSITE database. The PROSITE license is provided below and is taken from http://prosite.expasy.org/prosite_license.html.

PROSITE was created by the groups of Amos Bairoch at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in 1989.

Increased data flow and especially the automation of proteome analysis have created a requirement for resources, which cannot be addressed in full by public funding. 
In 1998, it has therefore been decided to ask non-academic users to financially contribute to the maintenance of the database.

Since September 1998:
Commercial users are asked to pay a yearly license fee.
No license fee is charged to academic users, nor is any restrictions be imposed on their non-commercial use or reuse of the data.
The funds raised are used to enhance PROSITE both in scope and quality.
All releases of PROSITE (since release number 15.0) are copyright.
Academic or commercial users can access PROSITE in the same way, but commercial users need their company to pay a license fee irrespective of the method by which they access the database.
Use of PROSITE for educational and training purposes (where this is the sole reason for the use of the service) is not subject to any license agreement.
Reference to or printing of the documentation part of PROSITE entries (within reason) remains allowed in publications.
Starting in September 1998, a system of an annual subscription fee for commercial use of the database has been implemented. The SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics has mandated Geneva Bioinformatics (GeneBio) SA to act as its representative for the purpose of concluding the necessary license agreements and levying the fees.
